    <p>Have you ever wanted to get away from the city for a couple of hours? Not too far to have a vacation but far enough to forget about the stresses of city life? Well this blog is the right place for you. The purpose of this blog is to be a collection of trips that I have made outside or around the city that you can use as a source of inspiration to get to your own getaways. Most of these trips will be weekend trips or short vacations during long three day weekends. I hope these posts can motivate others to also take initiative in getting out of their comfort zone and try something new given the time and the opportunity.
Most blogs will consist of a brief introduction of where the trip was and how long it took, followed by a (hopefully) good description of the route from and back to NYC, and the experiences I have encountered during my trips so that others can have a reference to follow if anyone decides to follow along my steps. Many young people are addicted to video games, use their phones hours on end, and lack motivation to do something independently on their own. The purpose of this blog is not only for me to share my experiences, but to be a source of inspiration for others to get out of their comfort shell.
These trips will not be anything out of reach for anyone with financial issues. Everything in these posts will most likely involve a walk, a bike ride, or train travel. Again, these are trips that are meant to be close to the city but far enough to take in a different environment for a few hours before returning back to the reality of the metropolis which tends to be monotone and dull.
There is nothing much left for me to say in this post, other than await for the coming trips of the future. I encourage all my readers to read these posts with an open mind and to try something new every now and then.
For now this is all. See you soon!</p>
