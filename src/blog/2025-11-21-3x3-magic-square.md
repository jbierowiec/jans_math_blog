# How to Construct a 3×3 Magic Square

## What is a Magic Square?

A **magic square** is a square grid filled with distinct positive integers such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals is the same.  
This constant sum is called the **magic constant**.

## Magic Constant Formula

For an \( n \times n \) magic square, the magic constant \( M \) is given by:

$$
M = \dfrac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2}
$$

For a \( 3 \times 3 \) square:

$$
M = \dfrac{3(3^2 + 1)}{2}
  = \dfrac{3(9 + 1)}{2}
  = \dfrac{30}{2}
  = 15
$$

Each row, each column, and both main diagonals must add up to 15.
